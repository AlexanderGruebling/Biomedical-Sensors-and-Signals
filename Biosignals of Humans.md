# Biosignals of Humans
## Biosignal and its classification
* Biosignal is a description of physiological phenomenon
* irrespective of nature of description
* propagation losses and coupling and conversion losses need to be taken into account
* classification of biosignals:
	* permanent vs. induced
	* static vs. dynamic
	* differentiate by origin
## Basic priniciples of sensing
### Sensing organs
* Primary sensing cells:
	* local depolarization e.g. at dendrites: mechanical force opens channels for Na+ to flow inside the cell --> local depolarization
	* this leads to locally positive charge inside the membrane, locally negative charge outside the membrane
	* thus a difference in charge across the cell membrane results, which induces an excitatory current
	* **bare nerve endings (dendrites) as receptors and nerve axon as output**
* Secondary sensing cells:
	* special cells
	* **special epithelium cells as receptors and synaptic cleft with folliwing nerve cell as output**
	* graded signal --> trigger zone acts as analogue to digital converter (coded with action potentials, thus coding by frequency)
	* maximum instantanous frequency is given by absolute refractive period: f_MAX = 1 / abs. ref. per. --> 500 Hz
* Why secondary cells? --> Stimuli that are so small that they are not able to depolarize membranes, amplification is needed
	* they thus need ATP energy consumption
* Sensing organs serve as conversion of amplitude-modulated potential into frequency-modulated signals
#### Receptors
* Tonic receptors: no adaptation, amplitude and duration coded
* Tonic-phased receptors: Medium Adaptation, amplitude and duration partly coded (as long as membrane potential is above threshold)
* Phasic receptors: AC Transmition, fast adaptation

Adaptation
: due to opening of K+ channels, hyperpolarization results, which leads to lower receptor potentials (adaptation!)
: thus, only sharp changes increase receptor potential

## Humans as sensory creatures
* Sensor systems mediate four attributes
	* Modality (class of stimulus)
	* Location
	* Intensity
	* Timing
### Touching
* per fingertip 300 receptors 
* mechanical, thermal and chemical receptors 
* receptors in dermis and epidermis
* bare nerve endings as receptors (primary)
* accomodation speed determines if velocity or accelaration is detected
* Mechanical receptors:
	* stress/stretch sensitive ion channels
	* Merkels discs --> slow adaptation --> intensity detector
	* Meissner corpuscle --> moderately rapid adaptation --> velocity detector
	* Ruffini endings --> slow adaptation --> intensity detector
	* Pacinian corpuscle --> very rapid adaptation --> accelaration detector
* Thermal receptors:
	* given membrane with channel:
		* if thermal expansion coefficient of channel > thermal expansion coefficient of membrane:
			* channels gets larger, Na+ enters the cell 
		* --> warm sensor 
		* --> cold sensor makes channels more narrow --> reduced K+ outflow --> depolarization 
	* chemical receptors:
		* operate based on complementarity: conformation and charge 
		* transmitter-gated channels
### Pain
* serves as protection
* primary sensing cells involved, called nociceptors
* nociceptors respond to extremes of temperature, pressure or chemicals
	* therme-sensitive
	* mechano-sensitive
	* acid-sensitive channels
* most nociceptors are polymodal, respond to all three types
* fire continuously
* what matters to brain --> ratio between nociceptor action and normal action 
* Transimission:
	* A-delta fibres for quick/sharp pain with stimulus 
	* C-fibres for slow/dull/burning pain even after stimulus 
* nociceptors do not adapt!
* sensitivity by nociceptors can be increased by inflammation --> reverse effect of adaptation
	* after long pain, multiplication of nociceptor channels can occur!
* Temporal ignorance of pain: release of endorphins to adjust acitivity of brain neurons processing Pain
* Gating mechanisms: pain mediated by a-delta and c-fibres alleviated by touch or simultanous activation --> touch activates A-beta fibres --> thicker than A-delta --> inhibit transmission of nociceptive signals to brain
#### Pain Perception
* Referred pain: pain from organs felt in certain skin areas (convergence of neurons, brain cannot differentiate source of signal)
* Phantom pain: severed sensory nerves continue to send pain signals, no observable tissue damage
* chronic pain: origin of pain already healed up, pain persits because of malfunctioning intermediate neurons

* nociceptors almost permanently activated, inhibitory systems as well --> no pain sensation per default
* Objective nociception dissociates from subjective pain

### Smell
* Millions olfactory receptors as neurons 
* mostly primary, phasic (only change given to brain)
* different receptors respond very unspecific (same smell activates many receptors)

### Taste
* Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Salty, Umami
* survival value: secretion of digestive enzymes
* based on secondary chemical receptors
* regional distribution of receptors 
* however, not topographical mapping in the brain 

### Hearing
* detection of mechanical vibrations
* sound enters Pinna (Outer ear) --> Auditory channel --> Eardrum --> Middle Ear (three bones) --> Oval window (Entrance of cochlear) --> Cochlear duct (Fluid filled) --> Vibration of basilar membrane --> Bending of sensory hairs --> Activates secondary cells 
#### Outer ear
* acts as resonating body
* for source localization
#### Middle Ear bones
* system of levers to overcome mechanic impedance msimath between air (low resistance) and fluid of inner ear (high resistance)
* sound amplifier: area of eardrum / area of oval window
* Frequencyy resolution:
	* maximum frequency of action potential: 500 Hz
	* Hearing frequency: 20 - 16.000 Hz --> no direct encoding possible
	* Solution:
		* basilar membrane differs in thickness: beginning very slim, end very thicker
		* this leads to different resonance frequencies: beginning resonates with high frequencies, end resonates with low frequencies
		* makes sense, since low frequency waves travel farther
		* beding of basilar membrane thus depends on frequency and loudness
		* this results in a logarithmical scale
### Sense of Balance
* inner ear, vestibular apparatus
* three fluid channels, oriented perpendicular to each other
* canals closed by jelly-like mass (cupula)
* cupula moves during rotation because of inertness of fluid 
* sensory hairs inside are bent with subsequent action impulses

# Mechanic Biosignals
## Operation of skin curvature sensor
### Principle
* Single magnetostrictive layer (ML) (magnetostrictivity --> permeability changes with mechanical force, compression vs. tension)
* Neutral bending plane remains in the centre of the ML
* Total Δμ=0
* To remedy this, a bilayer structure is introduced:
	* ML affixed to a nonmagnetic counter layer (CL)
* Sensor signal establishment:
	1. Generator
	2. U/I Converter
	3. Rectifier
	4. Lowpass
	5. Offset compensation
	6. Output
### Working point optimisation
* soft magnetic materials are subject to earths magnetic field (H~E~)
* Bilayer orientation within the earth magnetic field H~E~
* H~E~ induces within the ML a magnetic field H~E~*(<<H~E~)
* H~E~\* increases with decreasing orientation angle β
* TODO
## Application aspects
### Bending sensitivity
* σ > 0 for tension
* σ < 0 for compression
* 2D mechanical stress distribution
* Ideal bilayer: strong dependence of permittivity on curvature c
* Glued bilayer: less strong dependence on curvature c 
* Finite length bilayer --> strongly inhomogenous stress distribution!
* Sensitivity of sensor s can be given as changes in permittivity over changes in curvature:
	* s = Δμ / Δc = k~e~ \* k~m~
	* k~e~ ... magnetoelastic factor
		* k~e~ = dμ~r~/dσ~ML~
		* depends on material properties of ML
		* the better the magnetostrictive properties of the material, the higher the factor 
	* k~m~ ... mechanical factor
		* k~m~ = Δσ~ML~/Δc
		* depends on material properties of ML and CL, as well as BL dimensions
	* s is proportional to E~CL~ / E~ML~ and d~CL~ / d~ML~
		* the stiffer/thicker the CL layer, the higher is s
### Thermal sensitivity
* Every material has thermal expansion factor
* Usually, thermal expansion factor of CL is much higher than thermal expansion factor of ML (k~cl~ >> k~ml~)
* if both layers are fixed, the ML experiences tension --> increase in permeability with increase in temperature
* sensitivity is proportional to |k~ML~ - k~CL~|
## Monitoring on the neck
### Cardiac activity
* Systole vs. diastole
* Application for example on Arteria Carotis
* during systole, artery widens, leading to bending that is detected by the sensor 
### Respiratory activity
* mixed signal of cardiac and respiratory activity
* How to separate?
	* Linear filtering (fixed cutoff)
	* Adaptive filtering (adaptive cutoff)
		* estimation of f~c~ to use as cutoff in filter component
### Blood pressure
* Similar wave courses of s~c~ and p
* Respiratory-related variation of s~S,D~ and p~s~ 
	* p~s~ ... systolic blood pressure
	* s~S,D~ ... Systolic-diastolic deflection in s~c~
	* s~C~ ... Cardiac component of s
* Establishment of a model:
	* Δp = k \* ΔA / A = k \* (2 \* Δr) / r ≈ k \* (2 \* Δr) / r~D~
		* k ... elasticity modulus
	* Δr≈Δs --> can be measured with skin curvature sensor!
	* k = f(Δr) --> with increasing radius, stiffness increases
	* from v = √(k/p) it follows:
		* Δp = (ρ \* v^2^ \* 2 \* Δr) / r~D~ ≈ C~1~ \* Δp / τ^2^
			* τ ... Pulse arrival time
			* ρ ... blood density

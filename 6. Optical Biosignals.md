## Light interaction with tissue
### Light absorption
* Absorption law: I = I_0*e^(-µ_a*d)
	* I ... Intensity
	* I_0 ... Incident light Intensity
	* µ_a ... Absorption coefficient
	* d ... Pathlength of light
	* 1/µ_a ... space constant (of blood ~ 2mm --> after 2mm, 37% of light is absorbed)
	* µ_a dependence on wavelength λ of hemoglobin
* Light scattering
	* Dispersion of light due to chaotic variation in refreactive index
	* two types of scattering (depending on size of scatterer and wavelength of light)
		* s < λ --> Isotropic scattering (Rayleigh)
			* same scattering proportion in all directions
			* scattering magnitude scales to the power of λ^4, extremely wavelength dependent!
		* s <= λ --> Anisotropic scattering (Mie)
			* scattering magnitude scales to the power of λ
* Penetration and probing
	* Both describe depths to which the incident light penetrates the tissue
	* Penetration depth:
		* Depth at which I_0 has fallen by 1/e (~63%)
		* Given by 1/μ or 1/α
	* Probing depth:
		* Changes in optical properties at the depth z yield the associated changes of I of at least 5%
		* Key issue for reflection of light
		* z = (0.4*d^(1/2))/(μ_a*μ_s)^(1/4)
		* Note that there is a non-linear dependence of μ on λ and S
			* different light colors reuslt in different probing depths
			* thus, different layers of tissue can be probed
		* Increasing distance between light source and photodetector
			* results in greater probing depth
			* however, light intensity is lost
		* blood perfusion ↑ then z ↓
## Sensor operation
### Principle
* Optical plethysmography
* Registration of volume and absorption changes 
## Application issues
### Physiological considerations
* Light absorbers - compartmental model of tissue
	* during local systole in periphery, radius/circumference of vessel is increased
	* this results in larger absorption
	* compartmental model of tissue:
		1. pulsatile arterial blood
		2. non-pulsatile arterial blood
		3. venous blood
		4. bloodless tissue 
	* Cardiac sensitvity:
		* Local systole: μ_a * d ↑
		* Local diastole:  μ_a * d ↓
	* Respiratory sensitivity:
		* Inspiration: μ_a * d ↓
			* arterial blood: left ventricular stroke volume decreases, thus peripherial arterial radius decreases
			* venous blood: peripheral venous blood volume decreases, thus peripherial venous radius decreases
		* Expiration: μ_a * d ↑
	* Registration of arterial blood oxygenation S 
		1. define μ_a,p as absorption due to pulsatile arterial blood
			* μ_a,p = H/V * (S*σ_HbO+(1-S)*σ_Hb)
				* H ... Hematocrit (Percentage of red blood cells in blood)
				* V ... volume of a single red blood cell 
				* σ_HbO ... σ of red blood cells containing Oxyhemaglobin
				* σ_Hb ... σ of red blood cells containing Deoxyhemoglobin
		2. Apply compartmental model of tissue
			* ln(I/I_0) = -(μ_a,p \* d_p + μ_a,np \* d_np + μ_a,v \* d_v + μ_a,t \* d_t)
		3. Compute alternating intensity component:
			* I_AC = -I_0 * μ_a,p * e^-(μ_a,p \* d_p + μ_a,np \* d_np + μ_a,v \* d_v + μ_a,t \* d_t)*Δd_p
		* However, since alternating intensity component amounts only to 5% of the total I, the AC-to-DC ratio can be given as:
			* r = I_AC / I = -μ_a,p*Δd_p = I_AC / I_DC
		* in an experimental setting Δd_p is not known, so a ratio R can be defined
			* R gives the ratio of r at the red wave length to r at the infrared wave length
			* R = I_AC(R) / I_DC (R) / I_AC(IR) / I_DC(IR) = μ_a,p(R) / μ_a,p(IR)
		* How is this related to blood oxygenation?
			* Substituting μ_a,p for the formula given at 1., transforming for S and simplyfing leads to:
				* S = -0.26R + 1.11
		* Arterial saturation represents oxygen supply to tissues
		* Venours saturation represents oxygen uptake by tissues

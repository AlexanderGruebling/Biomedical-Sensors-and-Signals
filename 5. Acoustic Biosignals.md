# Acoustic Biosignals
## Generation of sounds
* General model:
	1. source of Biosginal (e.g. heart valves)
	2. Propagation losses
	3. Coupling and conversion losses
	4. Registration of BS
### Heart sounds
* generated through closure of the valves
* thus source is very concentrated (in constrast to lung sounds)
* first sound: closure of mitral and tricuspid valves --> loudest sound, low frequencies
* second sound: closure of more rigid aortic and pulmonic valves --> lower intensity, snapping quality
* other sounds: usually pathalogic
* spectrogram: amplitude is coded by color (the redder, the higher the amplitude)
* **heart sounds reside in frequency range up to 100 Hz**
* first heart sound comes after R peak, second after T
### Lung sounds
* numerous lung sounds
* normally 100-500 Hz 
* abnormal lung sounds up to 1 kHz
* airflow determines sound amplitude: s ~ F^2
* typically much weaker than heart sounds
* Classification according to:
	* origin
		* e.g. vesicular sounds (at peripheral lung fields, air turbulances, arise mainly during inspiration, distributed sources)
		* e.g. bronchial sounds (over large airways, turbulant airflow induces vibrations, central source)
	* sound type
		* continous sounds
			* due to temporal narrowing of airways
			* normal and pathological
		* discontinous sounds (pathological only)
			* explosive reopening of small airways during inspiration, e.g. because of excessive fluid)
### Snoring sounds
* normal snoring: 100 to 800 Hz
* obstructive snoring sounds: up to 2000 Hz
* Classification based on:
	* origin:
		* nasal vs oral Snoring
	* type of generation: 
		* normal (narrowing of airways during inspiration, due to stress, tiredness, alcohol)
		* obstructive snoring (narrowing and temporal occlusions of airways due to collapsability of airways and large masses obstructing airways)
	* signal waveform:
		* simple waveform snoring (sinusoidal, oscillations without closure)
		* complex waveform snoring (train structures, temporal colliding of airways)

## Transmission of sounds
### Propagation
* Concentrated sound sources (e.g. heart sounds)
* distributed sound sources (e.g. lung sounds)
* sound waves:
	* interrelation of time and frequency domain: lambda = v / f 
	* determination of v by propagation medium: v = sqrt(k / p) = sqrt(1 / (p*D)) (k ... module of volume elasticity)
	* the stiffer the medium (the higher the yonk modulus), the faster the velocity
* low frequency waves no only propagate through airways, but also through tissues:
	* ~ 100 Hz --> coupling into tissue
	* High frequency waves only propagate through airways
* geometrical damping factor: pressure is in proportion to 1 / r
* medium damping factor: e^(-a*r)
* Heart sounds:
	* p_H = k * (P_0 / r) * e^(-a*r)
	* note the geometrical damping factor as well as the medium damping factor in the equation
* Lung sounds:
	* Integral over whole area of lungs is necessary
	* p_L = k*∫(p(r)/r)*e^(-a*r)dV
* Where does damping factor come from?
	* inner friction: induction of thermal losses, draw energy from incident accoustical wave --> a_F ~ f^2
	* Thermal conduction: due to friction, differences in local medium temperature occur, which are then balanced
		* a_T = difference of specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume = a_T = f^2 
	* Molecular relaxation: vibration of molecules start with some delay at the expance of rotational and translational energies
		* delayed setting yields energy losses in accoustic fields
		* a_M ~ f^2
	* a = a_F + a_T + a_M

## Coupling and recording of sounds
### Coupling
* chestpiece as acoustic amplifier
* microphone as acoustic-elextric converter
* How do sounds pass from tissue into chestpiece?
	* Inhomogeneity effects
		* Reflection losses: R = (Z_A - Z_T) / (Z_A + Z_T)
			* Z_X ... sound radiation impedance (A->air, T->tissue)
			* simplified law, since skin is a multilayer structure
		* Refraction losses: v_A/v_T = sin(β_A)/sin(β_T)
			* the slower the propagation speed, the smaller is the resulting wavelength after crossing tissue/air interface
	* Chestpiece:
		* Membrane:
			*f_mn=(s_mn * v_m)/(2πr)
	* Microphone:
		* Microphone as converter
		* Spatial distribution of sounds 

## Application issues
	* Multiparametric monitoring
		* Cardiac activity
		* Respiratory activity 
		* Classification of breathing
		* Detection of apneas
